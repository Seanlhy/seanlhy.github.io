        I'm a third-year GIS major and CIS minor studying at the Ohio State University. Originally from Malaysia, I transferred to OSU in 2018 and started as a Computer Science major, but I switched to GIS later. I'm passionate about front-end development and I'm looking to get involved in an internship that would give me the opportunity to learn more about this field.
